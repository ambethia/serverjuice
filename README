This is a little mini tool to assist with the initial configuration of an
Ubuntu 8.04 VPS for Rails deployment using Passenger, Apache 2 and MySQL.

It has been tested on a linode.com VPS with their Ubuntu 8.04 distribution.

To use it, first clone the git repository:

  git clone git://github.com/sansdev/serverjuice.git

Then run the command with the hostname you wish to configure your VPS as:

  ./serverjuice totallyninja >serverjuice.sh

The tool simply generates a shell script on standard out. The safest way to
use the output is to collect it in a file and copy it to your blank server
where you can run it as root.

If you're feeling brave you can have the tool run the script directly on a
server:

  ./serverjuice --deploy mycoolserver.com totallyninja

This will ssh as root to mycoolserver.com and run the generated script.

I wrote this for Rails Rumble 2008 to save me some time on server setup.
There is a lot more that this script could do, but for now this is all I need.
